A modular, extensible framework written in Rust for simulating, analyzing, and optimizing various blockchain consensus algorithms.

## Motivation

Designing, testing, and tuning consensus algorithms for distributed systems like blockchains is complex and resource-intensive. Real-world testnets are expensive to run and difficult to control precisely. This framework aims to provide a powerful, cost-effective, and flexible simulation environment to:

* **Benchmark** different consensus algorithms (PoW, PoS, PBFT, Tendermint, HotStuff, Avalanche, etc.) under identical conditions.
* **Analyze** performance metrics like throughput, finality latency, and resource usage.
* **Evaluate** algorithm robustness against network failures (latency, partitions) and node faults (crashes, Byzantine behavior).
* **Optimize** algorithm parameters automatically to achieve desired performance characteristics.
* **Prototype** and validate new consensus mechanisms rapidly.

## Features

* Event-Driven Simulation Engine
* Modular Architecture (Rust Traits)
* Pluggable Consensus Algorithms (Planned: PoW, PBFT, PoS, Tendermint, HotStuff, Avalanche)
* Realistic Network Simulation (Topology, Latency, Bandwidth, Partitions)
* Fault Injection Framework (Crashes, Byzantine Faults)
* Comprehensive Metrics Collection
* Data Analysis Tools (Planned)
* Visualization Dashboard (Planned)
* Optimization Engine (Planned)
* Integration Capabilities (Planned)
